clods5XG's Personal Skin

v0.3.0 - Hot-Swap
A new direction for this skin is headed!

v0.4.0 - Squars n' Circls
Hot-Swap wasn't really a final name that we'd give this skin. To my eyes, it'll always be my skin that constantly changes.
I am working on some new graphics behind the scenes, but as I'm currently focusing a bit on lazer, I can't say for sure when the stable-side graphics are done.

v0.4.1 - Lovely thanks from the Cinderella Project
applause.wav is gone (but you can always put yours back in) in place of some newer applause-{s,a,b,c,d}.wav files that play according to what rank you get in lazer.
I'll get some more idols to congratulate your win (or mourn your loss) in the updates to come, so keep an eye out in the customizables folder inside the skin.

v0.4.2 - Neon
nekodex has made some new Argon samples for osu!lazer. We included them in this skin in case you want to see.

v0.4.3 - GIT READY!!
We're finally doing it! We're pushing this skin to GitHub!
Probably wanna make a readme.md now...
