clods5XG's Personal Skin Update Log

v0.8.0-indev - Around The Sun (Auguse 23, 2025)
This is an untracked release because I didn't use git this time due to the unfamiliarity of a new operating system at the time, aka Linux.

v0.7.0-git - Backburner (November 25, 2024)
I haven't worked on this skin for months. Maybe it won't be long before 1.0 comes.

v0.6.0-git - Major Inconveniences (June 19, 2024)
My internet died for half a month and so is Figma. But not before adding in song select!

v0.5.0-git - Huge Update (May 8, 2024)
Literally what it says.

v0.4.1-git - My Ears Are Gone (April 3, 2024)
Now you understand why I don't like adding in generic and overused hitsounds like Pong.

v0.4.0-git - This Skin is a Joke (April 1, 2024)
A lot of skins nowadays have one recurring theme when it comes to hitsounds. Just play with this skin and you'll know what I mean.

v0.3.0-git - Stop Staring at Suisei-san (March 16, 2024)
It's done. The Idolmaster font is gone in the skin. And here comes some more new stuff, as per usual.

v0.2.0-git - Spring Cleaning (March 13, 2024)
I've touched up a few things on my skin, and cleaned up some unused material.

v0.1.0-git - GIT READY!! (March 12, 2024)
Initial Git release. Hello World!

--- These changelog entries below are very old. So old, this skin didn't exist on GitHub when these were made!

v0.4.3 - GIT READY!!
We're finally doing it! We're pushing this skin to GitHub!
Probably wanna make a readme.md now...

v0.4.2 - Neon
nekodex has made some new Argon samples for osu!lazer. We included them in this skin in case you want to see.

v0.4.1 - Lovely thanks from the Cinderella Project
applause.wav is gone (but you can always put yours back in) in place of some newer applause-{s,a,b,c,d}.wav files that play according to what rank you get in lazer.
I'll get some more idols to congratulate your win (or mourn your loss) in the updates to come, so keep an eye out in the customizables folder inside the skin.

v0.4.0 - Squars n' Circls
Hot-Swap wasn't really a final name that we'd give this skin. To my eyes, it'll always be my skin that constantly changes.
I am working on some new graphics behind the scenes, but as I'm currently focusing a bit on lazer, I can't say for sure when the stable-side graphics are done.

v0.3.0 - Hot-Swap
A new direction for this skin is headed!
