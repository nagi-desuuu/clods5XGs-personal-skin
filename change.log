clods5XG's Personal Skin


v0.7.0-git - Backburner (November 25, 2024)
I haven't worked on this skin for months. Maybe it won't be long before 1.0 comes.

v0.6.0-git - Major Inconveniences (June 19, 2024)
My internet died for half a month and so is Figma. But not before adding in song select!

v0.5.0-git - Huge Update (May 8, 2024)
Literally what it says.

v0.4.1-git - My Ears Are Gone (April 3, 2024)
Now you understand why I don't like adding in generic and overused hitsounds like Pong.

v0.4.0-git - This Skin is a Joke (April 1, 2024)
A lot of skins nowadays have one recurring theme when it comes to hitsounds. Just play with this skin and you'll know what I mean.

v0.3.0-git - Stop Staring at Suisei-san (March 16, 2024)
It's done. The Idolmaster font is gone in the skin. And here comes some more new stuff, as per usual.

v0.2.0-git - Spring Cleaning (March 13, 2024)
I've touched up a few things on my skin, and cleaned up some unused material.
